# JSC-Constitution
This constitution revision for the Juilliard Student Council took place during the spring 2018 semester.

## Motivation
Bylaws are necessary for every organization to succeed. We began the 2017-2018 academic year with a dilapidated Constitution (`Before.pdf`) in which jargon impeded functionality and outdated structures did not reflect current practices. We identified a substantial update to the Constitution as a necessary capacity-building project entailing strategically sharpening our mission and vision. The result (`After.pdf`) is a significantly leaner, more powerful document.

## Themes
1. Simplify language
2. Clarify rules, especially about membership
3. Applying the "minimum viable product" (MVP) idea to constitutionally mandated structures
4. Asserting independence from the administration

## Thank-you's
Thank you to Juliana Han, DMA '18, for her extensive work and consultation on this project.
